## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Practiced the use of React hooks, validation and submission. Learned that unordered list bullets can be styled using CSS.

### Continued development

Add a mobile version. Implement useReducer to manage the email and email validity states in the SignUpForm component. Implement useContext to avoid prop drilling to send the email state.
